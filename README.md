# Gather-Round-AEC

#Problem Statement-
Meet-up platform by interests for Social activities:
Playing games or attending quizzes is a great way to meet new people. However,
due to the limits of off-campus living, we rarely meet up with new people. So build a
student platform for randomized matching on social/physical activities.
Benefit to students: Students can easily reach out to other students and socialize in
a healthy manner without the constraints of preconceived ideas. Thus they can
expand their social circle, form new bonds and take part in activities outside of their
regular circle.

#Abstract-
Gather Round AEC is an innovative Meet-up platform designed to connect 
students with similar interests and facilitate social and physical activities. This 
platform addresses the challenge of making new connections in a campus 
setting where it can be difficult to meet people outside of one's immediate 
circle. Gather Round AEC offers a unique solution to this problem by providing 
a platform where students can easily find others with common interests, 
participate in activities together, and expand their social circle.
The platform features a randomized matching system that allows students to 
connect with others who share similar interests and hobbies. Students can also 
initiate personal messages with other users, creating a more personalized 
connection. Additionally, the platform allows for the creation of channels, 
which can be used for group discussions, event planning, and other social 
interactions.
Gather Round AEC is built using modern technologies to ensure a fast, smooth, 
and reliable user experience. The platform is developed using ReactJS and Vite, 
providing an efficient and responsive front-end interface. The integration of 
GetStream API enhances the scalability and reliability of the platform, ensuring 
that it can handle large volumes of user activity without performance 
degradation.
To enhance the user interface, Gather Round AEC incorporates Tailwind CSS, a 
utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development of modern and 
stylish designs. This provides an aesthetically pleasing and engaging user 
experience that is consistent across all devices and screen sizes. Additionally, 
Twilio notifications are integrated into the platform to enable seamless 
communication and ensure that users never miss an important message or 
notification.
Overall, Gather Round AEC is a unique platform designed to foster a sense of 
community and facilitate social interactions among students. By providing a 
safe and healthy space for students to socialize, Gather Round AEC has the 
potential to improve student wellbeing, enhance their campus experience, and 
enable them to form lasting bonds with individuals who share similar interests
